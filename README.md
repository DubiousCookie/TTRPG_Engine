# TTRPG_Engine
A Program made with Godot to provide additional functionalities for TTRPGs, utilizing digital capabilities to improve the reading, playing and social experience. 

These Functionalities will be split into three parts:

1) Reading:
Instead of using PDF files, each page is a RichText File using BBCode: Providing the following Benefits:
  + The Ability to include gifs that showcase how rules must be carried out, provide additional insights into the World, or act as   Tutorials on how to interact with the program.
  + The Ability to include Hotlinks within text, allowing pages to link to one another and enable drop down menus for easy viewing of specific rules without flipping or scrolling through pages
  + With only one page being loaded in per tab, this leads to better optimization meaning multiple instances of the Book maybe open at once without causing high usage of Computer Resources.
  + Bookmark and Search Functionalities to reduce time spent looking for rules.
2) Playing:
As this Program is made using Godot, a Game Engine, Multiplayer Functionalities are present and are planned to be used to ease the process of going through combat and Character Management. With Planned Implementations including:
  + A custom Character Creator that does the Math for you, utilizing systems smoothlining the creation of backgrounds, the choosing of spells, miracles, and other abilities, and is able to create a Character sheet that you can further modify whenever you gain or use items, gain or lose HP, and spend XP to expand your Toolset.
  + A Interactable Combat Map that utilizes Tiles and tokens to present environements and Mosnters, it connects directly to the GM, allowing them to easily present dynamic and immersive combat encounters with an easy to understand interface, Damage Trackers, and a History function.
  + An inventory system that logs every item you add along with storing their condition, effects, and unique mechanics and flavorings
3) Socializing:
  + Soundscaping tools that allows the GM to easily play installed or custom ambience, sounds, and themes.
  + Private messaging features between a player and the GM along with the ability for the GM to "give" a player a specific item or weapon to ease the task of logging down finds on adventures.
  + The Ability to post images and gifs to provide additional visual context to players and help ease the task of explaining the world.

While this Code is currently under default Copyright Law, current plans include a shift into an open source format for the greater good of the TTRPG community.
